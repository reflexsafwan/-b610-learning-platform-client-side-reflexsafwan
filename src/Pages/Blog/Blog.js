            Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature
            that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from
            scripts running in the browser. If your REST API's resources receive
            non-simple cross-origin HTTP requests, you need to enable CORS
            support.

            Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
            implement authentication?
          </h2>
          <p className="max-w-full text-xl mb-2 text-gray-700">
            Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs,
            and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It
            supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular
            federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and
            more. <br /> <br />

            How does the private route work?
          </h2>
          <p className="max-w-full text-xl mb-2 text-gray-700">
            The private route component is similar to the public route, the only
            change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If the user
            is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login page and the
            user can only access the authenticated routes If he is authenticated
            (Logged in).

            What is Node? How does Node work?
          </h2>
          <p className="max-w-full text-xl mb-2 text-gray-700">
            Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing
            JavaScript code server-side. Node is useful for developing
            applications that require a persistent connection from the browser
            to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as
            chat, news feeds and web push notifications. <br />
            It is used as backend service where javascript works on the
            server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on both
            frontend and backend. Node. js runs on chrome v8 engine which
            converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable,
            lightweight, fast, and data-intensive.
